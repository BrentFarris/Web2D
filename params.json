{"name":"Web2d","tagline":"Event Driven JavaScript Game Framework","body":"### Welcome to Web2D\r\nWeb2D is an experimental event driven HTML5 Canvas based framework created by Brent Farris. It's development process revolves around making games, however it can be used for any HTML5 Canvas visual needs. Though there are many helpful JavaScript functions, extensions and classes in this library; it all started around the $Event class.\r\n\r\nEach internal class of the library is preceded with a \"$\" to denote that it is an library class. Later, many other helper classes will be added to an extensions direcotry that uses the main library but will not begin with a \"$\" as it is not part of the main library.\r\n\r\nNote: I would like to note that I am not bathed in the paradigms of the \"JavaScript norm\" so my choice of method name casing and such may seem \"weird\" to traditional JavaScript developers.\r\n\r\nHave fun and feel free to leave comments, clone, whatever!\r\n\r\n### Clone instructions\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_github_directory/Web2D\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/baflink/Web2D.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-54927529-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
